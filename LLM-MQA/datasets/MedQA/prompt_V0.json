He states that his symptoms started yesterday and have been worsening steadily. The patient endorses a recent weight loss of 7 pounds this past week and states that he feels diffusely itchy. The patient has a past medical history of alcohol abuse, obesity, asthma, and IV drug use. His current medications include metformin, atorvastatin, albuterol, and fluticasone. In addition, the patient admits to smoking and drinking more than usual lately due to the stress he has experienced. His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an ill-appearing man. The patient's skin appears yellow. Abdominal exam is notable for right upper quadrant tenderness. Cardiac and pulmonary exams are within normal limits. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below:\n\nHemoglobin: 14 g/dL\nHematocrit: 42%\nLeukocyte count: 5,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 70,000/mm^3\n\nPartial thromboplastin time: 92 seconds\nProthrombin time: 42 seconds\nAST: 1110 U/L\nALT: 990 U/L\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?", "options": {"A": "Appropriate acute management of a deep vein thrombosis", "B": "Decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity at birth", "C": "Prosthetic valve with appropriate post-operative care", "D": "Recent antibiotic treatment with gentamicin", "E": "Severe migraine headaches treated with acetaminophen"}, "choice": "E", "evidence_only": "First, we need to identify the patient's condition based on the information provided. The patient presents with fatigue, recent weight loss, diffuse itching, yellow skin, and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory values show thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and prolonged coagulation times. These findings suggest a diagnosis of acute liver failure.\n\nNext, we need to determine the cause of the patient's acute liver failure. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and obesity, which are risk factors for liver disease. He also has a history of IV drug use, which increases the risk of viral hepatitis. However, there is no mention of any recent drug use or exposure to hepatitis. The patient's medications (metformin, atorvastatin, albuterol, and fluticasone) are not known to cause liver damage.\n\nThe most likely cause of the patient's acute liver failure is acetaminophen toxicity. Acetaminophen is a common cause of acute liver failure, especially in patients who consume alcohol or have pre-existing liver disease. The patient admits to drinking more than usual lately due to stress, which may have increased his susceptibility to acetaminophen toxicity. The patient's history of severe migraine headaches treated with acetaminophen suggests that he may have been taking high doses of the medication, which can lead to liver damage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: Severe migraine headaches treated with acetaminophen."}, {"question": "A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 14 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit. She reports some nausea and fatigue. She takes lithium for bipolar disorder and completed a course of clindamycin for bacterial vaginosis 12 weeks ago. She works as a teacher at a local school. She smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 12 years but stopped after finding out that she was pregnant. She does not drink alcohol. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 14-week gestation. There is mild lower extremity edema bilaterally. Urinalysis is within normal limits. The patient's child is at increased risk for developing which of the following complications?", "options": {"A": "Ototoxicity and hearing loss", "B": "Atrialized right ventricle", "C": "Fetal hydantoin syndrome", "D": "Bone damage", "E": "Chorioretinitis\n\""}, "choice": "B", "evidence_only": "First, we need to identify any potential risk factors for the developing fetus. The patient's use of lithium is a known risk factor for cardiac defects, specifically Ebstein's anomaly, which involves an atrialized right ventricle. Therefore, option B is a potential complication for the fetus.\n\nThe other options are not associated with lithium use or the patient's medical history. Ototoxicity and hearing loss are associated with aminoglycoside use, which the patient did not receive. Fetal hydantoin syndrome is associated with the use of anticonvulsants, which the patient is not taking. Bone damage is not a known complication of any of the patient's medications or medical history. Chorioretinitis is associated with congenital infections such as toxoplasmosis, which the patient does not have.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Atrialized right ventricle."}, {"question": "A 26-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician because of a 4-day history of a nonproductive cough and chest pain. The pain is sharp and worse when she breathes deeply. During this time, she has also had two episodes of hematuria. Over the past 6 months, she has had intermittent pain, stiffness, and swelling in her fingers and left knee. She had two miscarriages at age 22 and 24. Her only medication is minocycline for acne vulgaris. Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an erythematous rash on her face. There is mild tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally with no warmth or erythema. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?", "options": {"A": "Anti-histone antibodies", "B": "Low serum levels of C3 and C4", "C": "Erosions of the metacarpophalangeal joints", "D": "Bilateral enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes", "E": "Cytotoxic glomerular antibodies"}, "choice": "B", "evidence_only": "The patient presents with a nonproductive cough, chest pain, and hematuria, which are all symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She also has a history of joint pain and two miscarriages, which are also associated with SLE. The erythematous rash on her face is a classic symptom of SLE as well.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of SLE, laboratory tests are needed. Anti-histone antibodies are associated with drug-induced lupus, which is not likely in this case as the patient's only medication is minocycline for acne vulgaris. Erosions of the metacarpophalangeal joints would suggest rheumatoid arthritis, which is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's other symptoms. Bilateral enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes would suggest sarcoidosis, which is not likely in this case as the patient does not have any respiratory symptoms. Cytotoxic glomerular antibodies would suggest rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's other symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be low serum levels of C3 and C4, which are commonly seen in SLE due to complement activation and consumption. This would confirm the diagnosis of SLE and help guide further management."}, {"question": "A 54-year-old woman comes to the physician because of paresthesias and weakness in her left leg for one year. Her symptoms have become progressively worse during this period and have led to some difficulty walking for the past month. She has had frequent headaches for the past 4 months. She has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. Current medications include amlodipine and levothyroxine. Her temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle strength in the left lower extremity. Deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremity are 4+ on the left and 2+ on the right side. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, and calcium are within the reference ranges. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": {"A": "Surgical resection", "B": "Whole brain radiotherapy", "C": "Stereotactic brain biopsy", "D": "Stereotactic radiosurgery", "E": "Intrathecal methotrexate therapy"}, "choice": "A", "evidence_only": "The patient is presenting with paresthesias and weakness in her left leg, which has progressively worsened over the past year. She also has frequent headaches and a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle strength in the left lower extremity and increased deep tendon reflexes on the left side. An MRI of the brain is shown, but we are not given the results of the MRI. \n\nBased on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a brain tumor, specifically a glioma or meningioma. The increased deep tendon reflexes on the left side suggest that there may be compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots, which could be caused by a tumor in the brain. \n\nThe most appropriate next step in management would be surgical resection of the tumor. This would allow for a definitive diagnosis and could potentially relieve the patient's symptoms. Whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic brain biopsy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and intrathecal methotrexate therapy are not appropriate options at this time, as they are either not indicated for this type of tumor or would not provide immediate relief of the patient's symptoms. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Surgical resection."}]
